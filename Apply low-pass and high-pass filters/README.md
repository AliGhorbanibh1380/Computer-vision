## Question :
Apply low-pass and high-pass filters on the png image "lena" in the spatial domain.
## Main Subject: 
Image Processing with Median Blur and Laplacian Filter in Python
## Description:

This Python script utilizes the OpenCV library to perform two fundamental image processing techniques: applying a median blur to reduce noise and performing edge detection with the Laplacian filter. The code consists of two main functions, one for blurring an image and the other for detecting edges, demonstrating effective methods for enhancing image quality and analyzing image structures. The results are displayed and saved as separate files for further inspection.

# Question:
You have been given the image jpg.degraded, which has suffered some kind of degradation and the image quality has decreased. Try to guess the type of degradation that has occurred on the image and apply a method to recover the image. The original, undamaged image is provided to you in jpg.clean.
# Image Denoising Using Median Filtering in Python
## Overview
This repository demonstrates a simple approach to image denoising using median filtering with OpenCV in Python. Median filtering is an effective noise reduction technique, particularly useful for removing "salt and pepper" noise from images while preserving edges better than other filtering techniques such as Gaussian blur.

## Key Concepts
### Median Filtering
Median filtering is a non-linear image processing technique that replaces each pixel's value with the median value of its neighboring pixels. This method is particularly effective for removing noise found in images, while maintaining the integrity of edges and important features.

### OpenCV
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning library that provides a wide range of tools for image and video processing tasks.
## Conclusion
This code serves as a basic example of how to perform image denoising using median filtering with OpenCV in Python. Median filtering is effective for reducing certain types of noise while preserving edges, making it a valuable tool in various image processing applications.

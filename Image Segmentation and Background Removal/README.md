# Image Segmentation and Background Removal using OpenCV
This code demonstrates how to extract a car from its original background in an image using Python's OpenCV library and perform background removal.

## The process involves two key steps:
- isolating the car from the sandy background  
- removing the black background to create a transparent image of the car.

This code provides a functional approach to segmenting a vehicle from its original environment and preparing it with a transparent background through the use of pixel manipulation techniques in OpenCV. Such techniques are widely applicable in computer vision tasks, including graphic design, photomontage creations, and automated image editing.

Question:A photo of a person has been provided to you, which you can see in jpg.man. Apparently, the photo is somewhat noisy and does not have sufficient clarity. Try to restore the clarity of this image using methods you know about frequency domain filtering (remove horizontal lines from the image). Explain your noise removal method in the report and also include the resulting image.
Frequency Domain Filtering with FFT in Python
This code demonstrates the process of frequency domain filtering of an image using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in Python. The technique involves manipulating the frequency components of an image to modify or remove certain details, effectively applying a filter.
Summary
This code illustrates a basic approach to frequency domain filtering, allowing the user to manipulate specific frequencies of an image. By setting certain frequency components to zero, frequencies associated with specific image details can be filtered out, resulting in a modified version of the original image.

The technique is useful in various applications such as image smoothing, noise reduction, and feature enhancement.
